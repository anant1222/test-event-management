# Test Event Management System - Powered by AI

## Overview

The **Test Event Management System** is an AI-driven platform designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and conducting timed multiple-choice tests. The system offers a robust feature set for both candidates and admins, enhancing the overall test-taking and management experience.

### Key Features

- **Candidate Side**:
  - Participate in timed multiple-choice tests.
  - Automatic scoring and feedback.
  - Restrict tab/window switching with auto-submission on violation (maximum 3 switches allowed).
  - User-friendly and responsive design for web and mobile devices.

- **Admin Side**:
  - Create and manage test papers with AI-generated questions.
  - Set test parameters such as difficulty, duration, and passing marks.
  - Manage test history, results, and notifications.
  - Advanced AI capabilities for question generation and test design.

- **AI Capabilities**:
  - Generate questions based on category and difficulty.
  - Use OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model to dynamically create unique multiple-choice questions with a balanced mix of difficulty levels.
  - Automatic UUID generation for questions and options to ensure uniqueness.

- **Scalability**:
  - Supports up to 100 concurrent candidates.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: Database interactions managed via custom `dbHelper`.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for generating questions with function calling.
- **Validation**: Custom validation with `requestParamsHandler`.
- **Security**: Password hashing with `bcryptjs`.
- **Unique Identifiers**: UUID for managing question and option IDs.

## Project Structure

- `routes/`: Contains API route definitions.
- `controllers/`: Logic for handling incoming requests and responses.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for validation, API requests, and response handling.
- `models/`: Database models for managing question sets, user data, and test information.
- `services/`: Integration with OpenAI for AI-based question generation.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/w3villa-suraj-bisht/test-event-management.git
    cd test-event-management-system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

     DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
     PORT=3000
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## API Endpoints

### Admin APIs

- **Generate Questions**: Uses OpenAI to generate questions based on the provided category and difficulty.
- **Create Test**: Admin can create a new test by defining parameters like duration, passing marks, and maximum tab switch attempts.
- **View Results**: Admin can review candidate scores and manage test results.

### Candidate APIs

- **Start Test**: Candidates can start their assigned test within the given duration.
- **Submit Test**: Automatic and manual submission options with tab switch restrictions.

## Key Functions

## Error Handling

- **Validation Errors**: Specific messages for invalid categories, difficulties, passing marks, and other test parameters.
- **Server Errors**: Handles unexpected errors with standardized responses.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced AI Feedback**: Provide more descriptive feedback for incorrect answers during candidate testing.
- **Adaptive Testing**: Adjust question difficulty based on candidate performance in real-time.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed reporting and analytics for test performance and question effectiveness.
